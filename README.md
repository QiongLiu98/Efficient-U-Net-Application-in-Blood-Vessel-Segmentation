# Efficient-U-Net-Application-in-Blood-Vessel-Segmentation
We present more efficient U-Net architecture for blood vessel segmentation from retinal fundus image.
***
1.In this work computationally efficient UNet architecture with lesser parameter has been proposed.

2.3 different architecture with pre-training strategies have been employed and comparative analysis has been done.

3.Obtained results have shown the efficacy of the modified UNet architecture for blood vessel segmentation.
